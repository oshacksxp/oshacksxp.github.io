            <p class = "section-text">
                Have you ever wanted to join a hackathon or learn how to develop websites, 
                but didn't know where to start? We invite you to join DevStart!
            </p>
            <p class = "section-text">
                DevStart is a two-day long hackathon that aims to empower participants with 
                essential skills in hackathons and web development. It's completely 
                beginner-friendly - any senior high school or college student can join, 
                regardless of their experience!
            </p>
            <p class = "section-text">
                Participants can register in teams of 3 - 4 starting this April 28. If you 
                don't have a team, don't worry - you can register individually, and we'll 
                help you find a team.

                    Though hackathons encourage newcomers, many who join without any coding 
                    knowledge feel lost and intimidated. DevStart needs your help to provide 
                    a better experience. We're looking for people who can host workshops 
                    teaching web development skills. Mentors and judges experienced in 
                    web development are also welcome!
