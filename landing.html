                    participants can socialize and ask for help from mentors. We’ll send you 
                    the links to both once you sign up.

                    A hackathon is best described as an “invention marathon”. Anyone can 
                    attend a hackathon to learn, build, and share their creations in a relaxed 
                    and welcoming atmosphere. Hackathons are about creating, not coding - you 
                    don’t have to be a programmer or computer science major to thrive!

                <p>
                    In DevStart, you’ll be given 30 hours to make a website. You can make any 
                    website, as long as it follows the theme that we’ll be giving you during the 
                    event. After making the website, you’ll be presenting it to a panel in a 
                    casual judging session.

                    DevStart is committed to be a hackathon that anyone can join, no matter how 
                    much experience they have. First timers and people with little coding experience 
                    are often intimidated by hackathons - at DevStart, we want to create an inclusive 
                    environment that shows them there’s nothing to fear. We also hope to teach skills 
                    that participants can use in their lives and in future hackathons.

                    At DevStart, you won’t just learn how to make a website. You’ll also be gaining 
                    valuable experiences in joining a hackathon, from working as a team to 
                    presenting projects.

                    Though hackathons encourage newcomers, many who join without any coding

                    a better experience. We're looking for people who can host workshops 
                    teaching web development skills. Mentors and judges experienced in
