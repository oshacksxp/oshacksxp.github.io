                <p class = "section-text">
                    DevStart is all about teaching participants essential, foundational skills in web development and in hackathons. As a speaker, you will be able to play a direct part in that mission. In the morning or afternoon of May 22nd, speakers will give a talk or workshop from 30 minutes to an hour that teaches skills including but not limited to HTML/CSS/Javascript, github, ui/ux, pitching, prototyping, and more. 
                </p>
                <h3 class = section-title>Mentors</h3>
                <p class = "section-text">
                    When teams are working on their projects, they can contact you through Discord for assistance. Our participants will greatly benefit from your guidance and expertise! Participants will work from 4:00 pm on May 22 to 4:00pm on May 23, but Mentors can choose any time within that period to be available for consultation. 
                </p>
                <h3 class = section-title>Judges</h3>
                <p class = "section-text">
                    One of the best ways to learn is to receive the criticism and advice of an expert. In the afternoon of May 23, teams will pitch their projects to a panel of Judges, who are tasked to evaluate the team's work using a rubric, give constructive criticism, and ultimately choose the winning team.
