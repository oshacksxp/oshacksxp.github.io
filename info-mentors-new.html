                DevStart is all about teaching participants essential, foundational skills in 
                web development and in hackathons. As a speaker, you will be able to play a 
                direct part in that mission. In the morning or afternoon of May 22nd, speakers 
                will give a talk or workshop from 30 minutes to an hour that teaches skills 
                including but not limited to HTML/CSS/Javascript, github, ui/ux, pitching, 
                prototyping, and more. 
            </p>
            <h3 class = section-title>Mentors</h3>
            <p class = "section-text">
                When teams are working on their projects, they can contact you through Discord 
                for assistance. Our participants will greatly benefit from your guidance and 
                expertise! Participants will work from 4:00 pm on May 22 to 4:00pm on May 23, 
                but Mentors can choose any time within that period to be available for consultation. 
            </p>
            <h3 class = section-title>Judges</h3>
            <p class = "section-text">
                One of the best ways to learn is to receive the criticism and advice of an expert. 
                In the afternoon of May 23, teams will pitch their projects to a panel of Judges, 
                who are tasked to evaluate the team's work using a rubric, give constructive criticism, 
                and ultimately choose the winning team.
